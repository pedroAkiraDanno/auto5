## NOTES/INFOS: 

**Long-term support (LTS)**  is a product lifecycle management policy in which a stable release of computer software is maintained for a longer period of time than the standard edition. The term is typically reserved for open-source software, where it describes a software edition that is supported for months or years longer than the software's standard edition.

Exist 2 folder about automation in **postgresql** **ansible24** and **terraform** .
